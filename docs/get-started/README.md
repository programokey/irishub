## What is IRISnet

IRISnet) is named after Greek goddess (**Iris**)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_(mythology)], said to be the personification of the rainbow and the faithful messenger between heaven and humanity.

### Upgrade to Validator Node

You now have an active full node. What's the next step? 

If you have participated in the genesis file generation process, you should be a validator once you are fully synced. 

If you miss the genesis file generation process, you can still upgrade your full node to become a IRISnet Validator. The top 100 validators have the ability to propose new blocks to the IRIS Hub. Continue onto [the Validator Setup]().

### Setup a sentry node

A validator is under the risk of being attacked. You could follow this [guide](tools/Setup_Sentrynode.md) to setup a sentry node to protect yourself.
